Transform the following transcript into valid structured JSON with these fields:

- "title": A catchy, clear title summarizing the main topic
- "objective": 1â€“2 learning objectives
- "summary": A short paragraph overviewing the topic
- "highlights": Memorable or useful moments from the transcript
- "keyInsights": 3â€“5 powerful insights or life lessons drawn from the topic
- "keyPoints": 3â€“7 essential teaching points or explanations
- "concepts": A dictionary of key terms with brief definitions
- "examples": Two real-world examples of applying the concept:
  - One for **children** or beginner learners
  - One for **adults** or advanced learners
- "whyItMatters": Explain why this skill or knowledge is important in real life
- "whatIfNotUsed": What problems arise if this isnâ€™t known or applied
- "useCases": Where and how this topic is used today (industries, roles, daily life)
- "globalBestPractices": A short paragraph about how the topic is approached by top countries, cultures, or institutions (e.g., Japan for discipline, Germany for engineering)
- "visualGuide": (If applicable) Step-by-step breakdown that could be drawn or animated
- "stepsToApply": Checklist or process to use this knowledge
- "reflection": 1 deep thinking or journaling question
- "quiz": 3â€“5 short self-test questions (MCQ or open-ended)
- "exploreMore": Where to learn more (e.g., books, websites, courses, public figures)
- "finalInsight": A powerful concluding thought or motivational message

Rules:
- Return **valid JSON only**
- Do NOT include extra text, explanation, or markdown
- Be clear, engaging, and make the content usable in **real-world learning** settings
