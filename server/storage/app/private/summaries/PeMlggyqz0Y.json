  "summary": "Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that involves teaching computers to learn from and make predictions based on data. Initially defined by Arthur Samuel in 1959, it allows computers to improve automatically through experience. The process begins with acquiring and cleaning data, followed by feature engineering to enhance the data's representation of the problem. After splitting the data into training and testing sets, an appropriate algorithm is selected for model building. These algorithms, which range from simple statistical models to complex neural networks, refine their predictions by minimizing an error function. The outcome is a model deployed either locally or on the cloud to deliver real-world applications.",
