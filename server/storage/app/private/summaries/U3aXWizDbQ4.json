  "title": "Mastering C Programming: Harnessing the Language that Powers Technology",
  "objective": [
    "Understand the essential features and operation of the C programming language.",
    "Learn how to write, compile, and manage memory in C code effectively."
  ],
  "summary": "C programming, a pivotal procedural language developed in 1972 by Dennis Richie, is imperative for systems programming given its direct compilation to machine code and minimal runtime support. This language forms the backbone of many modern operating systems and tools such as Windows, Linux, and software like MySQL and Git. C combines high-level language accessibility with low-level control over system resources, requiring programmers to manage memory manually. This introduction covers the basics of writing, compiling, and memory management in C, utilizing the GCC compiler, and understanding the implications of pointers, integers, and character types in system operations.",
