Hardware there's no garbage collector
instead your code needs to manage its
own memory when you create a variable
it's assigned an address in memory you
can store that address in another
variable called a pointer when the
variable is no longer needed you'll need
to free it to avoid memory leaks to get
started install a c compiler a popular
choice is the g c compiler or GCC create
a file ending in. C include any
libraries you plan to use then add a
main function to it this is where your
program will start executing there's no
function keyword and notice how it
returns an integer type a return value
of zero means success while a return
value of one means failure there are
only a few basic types in C create a
variable by starting with a type
followed by a name and value use print F
to print the value to the standard
output or put an Amper standand in front
of it to reference its address in memory
there's no string type but instead Char
which represents a one by character
stored as an integer a string can be
created with an array of characters each
letter will have its own memory address
and be terminated by a null character
another approach is to start with a
pointer by adding a star character in
front of the type then we can allocate
four bytes to it now assign a character
to each index ending with the null
character to create a string when you no
longer need that memory allocated to
your program use free to release it back
