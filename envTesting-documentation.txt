What is .env.testing?
.env.testing is a special environment file used only when running Laravel tests (php artisan test or PHPUnit).
It allows Laravel to separate the test environment from the real application environment, making sure that tests run safely, fast, and isolated.

Why we created .env.testing

Reason	Explanation
Protect real database	
Avoid accidentally inserting, deleting, or modifying real user data during tests

Faster test runs	Use in-memory database (SQLite :memory:) to speed up migrations and queries

Separate environment settings	Use different cache, session, queue drivers for testing only

Professional standard	All serious Laravel projects use .env.testing for clean, reliable CI/CD pipelines

What we put inside .env.testing
Hereâ€™s the final .env.testing content we used:


APP_ENV=testing
APP_KEY=base64:GeneratedByKeyGenerateCommand
APP_DEBUG=true
APP_URL=http://localhost

DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
DB_DATABASE=:memory:

CACHE_DRIVER=array
QUEUE_CONNECTION=sync
SESSION_DRIVER=array


APP_ENV=testing	Tells Laravel: "I'm running in TEST MODE"
APP_KEY=...	Needed for encryption to work during tests (sessions, cookies, etc.)
APP_DEBUG=true	Show errors easily if a test fails
APP_URL=http://localhost	Local base URL
DB_CONNECTION=sqlite	Use SQLite instead of MySQL/Postgres for testing (lighter, no setup)
DB_DATABASE=:memory:	Use in-memory database, built fresh every test run (fast + clean)
CACHE_DRIVER=array	Store cache in RAM, not Redis/Memcached
QUEUE_CONNECTION=sync	Process jobs immediately without a queue worker
SESSION_DRIVER=array	Store session data in memory, not in files/database
